\chapter{Integrating differential forms}
We now show how to integrate differential forms over cells,
and state Stokes' theorem in this context.
In this chapter, all vector spaces are finite-dimensional and real.

\section{Motivation: line integrals}
Given a function $g \colon [a,b] \to \RR$,
we know by the fundamental theorem of calculus that
\[
	\int_{[a,b]} g(t) \; dt = f(b) - f(a)
\]
where $f$ is a function such that $g = df/dt$.
%(You might recognize this more readily
%as the more customary $\int_a^b g(t) \; dt$.)
Equivalently, for $f \colon [a,b] \to \RR$,
\[ \int_{[a,b]} g \; dt = \int_{[a,b]} df = f(b) - f(a) \]
where $df$ is the exterior derivative we defined earlier.

Cool, so we can integrate over $[a,b]$.
Now suppose more generally, we have $U$ an open subset of our real vector space $V$
and a $1$-form $\alpha \colon U \to V^\vee$.
We consider a \vocab{parametrized curve}, which is a smooth function $c \colon [a,b] \to U$.
Picture:
\begin{center}
	\begin{asy}
		size(8.5cm);
		pair A = (-13,0);
		pair B = (-9,0);
		draw(A--B, grey);
		dot(A, grey); dot(B, grey);
		label("$[a,b]$", A--B, dir(90), grey);
		dot("$t$", 0.3*A+0.7*B, dir(-90), grey);

		draw( (-8,0) -- (-6,0) , EndArrow);
		label("$c$", (-7,0), dir(90));

		bigblob("$U$");
		pair a = (-2,-2);
		pair b = (3,0);
		pair p = (0,1);
		pair q = (2,0);
		label("$c$", q, dir(45), red);
		draw(a..p..q..b, red);
		dot("$p = c(t)$", p, dir(90), blue);
		draw(p--(p+1.5*dir(-10)), blue, EndArrow);

		draw( (0,-4)--(0,-8), EndArrow );
		label("$\alpha$", (0,-6), dir(0));
		label("$\alpha_p(v) \in \mathbb R$", (0,-9), heavygreen);

		draw( (-10,-1)--(-1,-8), EndArrow);
		label("$c^\ast \alpha$", (-5.5,-4.5), dir(225));
	\end{asy}
\end{center}

We want to define an $\int_c \alpha$ such that:
\begin{moral}
	The integral $\int_c \alpha$ should add up all the $\alpha$ along the curve $c$.
\end{moral}
Our differential form $\alpha$ first takes in a point $p$ to get $\alpha_p \in V^\vee$.
Then, it eats a tangent vector $v \in V$ to the curve $c$ to finally give a real number $\alpha_p(v) \in \RR$.
We would like to ``add all these numbers up'',
using only the notion of an integral over $[a,b]$.

\begin{exercise}
	Try to guess what the definition of the integral should be.
	(By type-checking, there's only one reasonable answer.)
\end{exercise}

So, the definition we give is
\[ \int_c \alpha \defeq
	\int_{[a,b]} \alpha_{c(t)} \left( c'(t) \right) \; dt.  \]
Here, $c'(t)$ is shorthand for $(Dc)_{c(t)}(1)$.
It represents the \emph{tangent vector} to the curve $c$ at the point $p=c(t)$,
at time $t$.
(Here we are taking advantage of the fact that $[a,b]$ is one-dimensional.)

Now that definition was a pain to write, so we will define a differential
$1$-form $c^\ast \alpha$ on $[a,b]$ to swallow that entire thing:
specifically, in this case we define $c^\ast\alpha$ to be
\[ \left( c^\ast \alpha \right)_t (\eps) = \alpha_{c(t)} \cdot (Dc)_{t} (\eps) \]
(here $\eps$ is some displacement in time).
Thus, we can more succinctly write
\[ \int_c \alpha \defeq \int_{[a,b]} c^\ast \alpha. \]
This is a special case of a \emph{pullback}:
roughly, if $\phi \colon U \to U'$ (where $U \subseteq V$, $U' \subseteq V'$),
we can change any differential $k$-form $\alpha$ on $U'$
to a $k$-form on $U$.
In particular, if $U = [a,b]$,\footnote{OK,
	so $[a,b]$ isn't actually open, sorry.
	I ought to write $(a-\eps, b+\eps)$, or something.}
we can resort to our old definition of an integral.
Let's now do this in full generality.

\section{Pullbacks}
Let $V$ and $V'$ be finite dimensional real vector spaces (possibly different dimensions)
and suppose $U$ and $U'$ are open subsets of each;
next, consider a $k$-form $\alpha$ on $U'$.

Given a map $\phi \colon U \to U'$ we now want to define a pullback in
much the same way as before.
Picture:
\begin{center}
	\begin{asy}
		size(13cm);
		bigblob("$U$");
		pair p = (-1,0);
		dot("$p$", p, dir(90), red);
		pair p1 = p + 1.4*dir(150);
		pair p2 = p + 1.7*dir(-50);
		draw(p--p1, red, EndArrow);
		draw(p--p2, red, EndArrow);

		add(scale(0.8)*shift(14*dir(180))*CC());
		bigblob("$U'$");
		pair q = (-0.5,0.5);
		dot("$q = \phi(p)$", q, dir(90), blue);
		pair q1 = q + 1.8*dir(-100);
		pair q2 = q + 2.3*dir(-10);
		draw(q--q1, blue, EndArrow);
		draw(q--q2, blue, EndArrow);

		draw((-9,0)--(-3,0), EndArrow);
		label("$\phi$", (-6,0), dir(90));

		draw( (0,-4)--(0,-8), EndArrow );
		label("$\alpha$", (0,-6), dir(0));
		label("$\alpha_q(\dots) \in \mathbb R$", (0,-9), heavygreen);

		draw( (-11,-3)--(-1,-8), EndArrow);
		label("$\phi^\ast \alpha$", (-6,-6), dir(225));
	\end{asy}
\end{center}

Well, there's a total of about one thing we can do.
Specifically: $\alpha$ accepts a point in $U'$ and $k$ tangent vectors in $V'$,
and returns a real number.
We want $\phi^\ast \alpha$ to accept a point in $p \in U$
and $k$ tangent vectors $v_1, \dots, v_k$ in $V$,
and feed the corresponding information to $\alpha$.

Clearly we give the point $q = \phi(p)$.
As for the tangent vectors, since we are interested in volume, we take the
derivative of $\phi$ at $p$, $(D\phi)_p$, which will scale each of our vectors $v_i$
into some vector in the target $V'$.
To cut a long story short:
\begin{definition}
	Given $\phi \colon U \to U'$ and $\alpha$ a $k$-form, we define the \vocab{pullback}
	\[
		(\phi^\ast \alpha)_p(v_1, \dots, v_k)
		\defeq \alpha_{\phi(p)}
		\left( (D\phi)_p(v_1), \dots, (D\phi)_p(v_k) \right).
	\]
\end{definition}

There is a more concrete way to define the pullback using bases.
Suppose $w_1, \dots, w_n$ is a basis of $V'$
and $e_1, \dots, e_m$ is a basis of $V$.
Thus, by the projection principle (\Cref{thm:project_principle})
the map $\phi \colon V \to V'$ can be thought of as
\[ \phi(v) = \phi_1(v) w_1 + \dots + \phi_n(v) w_n \]
where each $\phi_i$ takes in a $v \in V$ and returns a real number.
We know also that $\alpha$ can be written concretely as
\[ \alpha = \sum_{J \subseteq \{1, \dots, n\}} f_J w_J. \]
Then, we define
\[
	\phi^\ast\alpha
	= \sum_{I \subseteq \{1, \dots, m\}}
	(f_I \circ \phi) (D\phi_{i_1} \wedge \dots \wedge D\phi_{i_k}).
\]
A diligent reader can check these definitions are equivalent.
\begin{example}
	[Computation of a pullback]
	Let $V = \RR^2$ with basis $\ee_1$ and $\ee_2$,
	and suppose $\phi \colon V \to V'$ is given by sending
	\[ \phi(a\ee_1 + b\ee_2) = (a^2+b^2)w_1 + \log(a^2+1) w_2 + b^3 w_3 \]
	where $w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$ is a basis for $V'$.
	Consider the form $\alpha_q = f(q) w_1 \wedge w_3$, where $f \colon V' \to \RR$.
	Then
	\[ (\phi^\ast\alpha)_p = f(\phi(p)) \cdot (2a \ee_1^\vee + 2b\ee_2^\vee) \wedge (3b^2 \ee_2^\vee)
		= f(\phi(p)) \cdot 6ab^2 \cdot \ee_1^\vee \wedge \ee_2^\vee. \]
\end{example}

It turns out that the pullback basically behaves nicely as possible, e.g.\
\begin{itemize}
	\ii $\phi^\ast(c\alpha + \beta) = c\phi^\ast \alpha + \phi^\ast\beta$ (linearity)
	\ii $\phi^\ast(\alpha\wedge\beta)
	= (\phi^\ast \alpha)\wedge(\phi^\ast \beta)$
	\ii $\phi_1^\ast(\phi_2^\ast(\alpha))
	= (\phi_2 \circ \phi_1)^\ast(\alpha)$ (naturality)
\end{itemize}
but I won't take the time to check these here
(one can verify them all by expanding with a basis).

\section{Cells}
\prototype{A disk in $\RR^2$ can be thought of as the cell
	$[0,R]\times[0,2\pi] \to \RR^2$ by
	$(r,\theta) \mapsto (r\cos\theta)\ee_1 + (r\sin\theta)\ee_2$.}
Now that we have the notion of a pullback,
we can define the notion of an integral for more general spaces.
Specifically, to generalize the notion of integrals we had before:
\begin{definition}
	A \vocab{$k$-cell} is a smooth function $c \colon [a_1, b_1] \times [a_2,b_2] \times \dots [a_k, b_k] \to V$.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
	[Examples of cells]
	Let $V = \RR^2$ for convenience.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\ii A $0$-cell consists of a single point.
		\ii As we saw, a $1$-cell is an arbitrary curve.
		\ii A $2$-cell corresponds to a $2$-dimensional surface.
		For example, the map $c \colon [0,R] \times [0,2\pi] \to V$ by
		\[ c \colon (r,\theta) \mapsto (r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta) \]
		can be thought of as a disk of radius $R$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
So we can now give the definition.
\begin{definition}
	[How to integrate differential $k$-forms]
	Take a differential $k$-form $\alpha$ and a $k$-cell $c \colon [0,1]^k \to V$.
	Define the integral $\int_c \alpha$ using the pullback
	\[ \int_c \alpha \coloneqq \int_{[0,1]^k} c^\ast \alpha. \]
\end{definition}
Since $c^\ast \alpha$ is a $k$-form on the $k$-dimensional unit box,
it can be written as $f(x_1, \dots, x_n) \; dx_1 \wedge \dots \wedge dx_n$,
So the above integral could also be written as
\[ \int_0^1 \dots \int_0^1 f(x_1, \dots, x_n) \; dx_1 \wedge \dots \wedge dx_n. \]

\begin{example}[Area of a circle]
	Consider $V = \RR^2$ and let $c \colon (r,\theta) \mapsto (r\cos\theta)\ee_1 + (r\sin\theta)\ee_2$
	on $[0,R] \times [0,2\pi]$ as before.
	Take the $2$-form $\alpha$ which gives $\alpha_p = \ee_1^\vee \wedge \ee_2^\vee$ at every point $p$.
	Then
	\begin{align*}
		c^\ast\alpha &=
		\left( \cos\theta dr - r\sin\theta d\theta \right)
		\wedge
		\left( \sin\theta dr + r\cos\theta d\theta \right) \\
		&= r(\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta) (dr \wedge d\theta) \\
		&= r \; dr \wedge d\theta
	\end{align*}
	Thus,
	\[ \int_c \alpha
		= \int_0^R \int_0^{2\pi} r \; dr \wedge d\theta
		= \pi R^2 \]
	which is the area of a circle.
\end{example}

Here's some geometric intuition for what's happening.
Given a $k$-cell in $V$, a differential $k$-form $\alpha$ accepts a point $p$ and some tangent vectors $v_1$, \dots, $v_k$
and spits out a number $\alpha_p(v_1, \dots, v_k)$,
which as before we view as a signed hypervolume.
Then the integral \emph{adds up all these infinitesimals across the entire cell}.
In particular, if $V = \RR^k$ and we take the form $\alpha \colon p \mapsto \ee_1^\vee \wedge \dots \wedge \ee_k^\vee$,
then what these $\alpha$'s give is the $k$th hypervolume of the cell.
For this reason, this $\alpha$ is called the \vocab{volume form} on $\RR^k$.

You'll notice I'm starting to play loose with the term ``cell'':
while the cell $c \colon [0,R] \times [0,2\pi] \to \RR^2$ is supposed to be a function
I have been telling you to think of it as a unit disk (i.e.\ in terms of its image).
In the same vein, a curve $[0,1] \to V$ should be thought of as a curve in space,
rather than a function on time.

This error turns out to be benign.
Let $\alpha$ be a $k$-form on $U$ and $c \colon [a_1, b_1] \times \dots \times [a_k, b_k] \to U$ a $k$-cell.
Suppose $\phi \colon [a_1', b_1'] \times \dots [a_k', b_k'] \to [a_1, b_1] \times \dots \times [a_k, b_k]$;
it is a \vocab{reparametrization} if $\phi$ is bijective and $(D\phi)_p$ is always invertible
(think ``change of variables'');
thus
\[ c \circ \phi \colon [a_1', b_1'] \times \dots \times [a_k',b_k'] \to U \]
is a $k$-cell as well.
Then it is said to \vocab{preserve orientation} if $\det(D\phi)_p > 0$ for all $p$
and \vocab{reverse orientation} if $\det(D\phi)_p < 0$ for all $p$.
\begin{exercise}
	Why is it that exactly one of these cases must occur?
\end{exercise}

\begin{theorem}
	[Changing variables doesn't affect integrals]
	Let $c$ be a $k$-cell, $\alpha$ a $k$-form, and $\phi$ a reparametrization.
	Then
	\[ \int_{c \circ \phi} \alpha
		=
		\begin{cases}
			\int_c \alpha & \phi \text{ preserves orientation} \\
			- \int_c \alpha & \phi \text{ reverses orientation}.
		\end{cases}
	\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Use naturality of the pullback to reduce it to the corresponding
	theorem in normal calculus.
\end{proof}

So for example, if we had parametrized the unit circle as $[0,1] \times [0,1] \to \RR^2$
by $(r,t) \mapsto R\cos(2\pi t) \ee_1 + R\sin(2\pi t) \ee_2$, we would have arrived at the same result.
So we really can think of a $k$-cell just in terms of the points it specifies.

\section{Boundaries}
\prototype{The boundary of $[a,b]$ is $\{b\}-\{a\}$. The boundary of a square goes around its edge counterclockwise.}
First, I introduce a technical term that lets us consider multiple cells at once.
\begin{definition}
	A \vocab{$k$-chain} $U$ is a formal
	linear combination of $k$-cells over $U$,
	i.e.\ a sum of the form
	\[ c = a_1 c_1 + \dots + a_m c_m \]
	where each $a_i \in \RR$ and $c_i$ is a $k$-cell.
	We define $\int_c \alpha = \sum_i a_i \int c_i$.
\end{definition}
In particular, a $0$-chain consists of several points, each with a given weight.

Now, how do we define the boundary?
For a $1$-cell $[a,b] \to U$, as I hinted earlier we want the answer to be the $0$-chain $\{c(b)\}-\{c(a)\}$.
Here's how we do it in general.
\begin{definition}
	Suppose $c \colon [0,1]^k \to U$ is a $k$-cell.
	Then the \vocab{boundary} of $c$, denoted $\partial c \colon [0,1]^{k-1} \to U$,
	is the $(k-1)$-chain defined as follows.
	For each $i = 1,\dots,k$ define $(k-1)$-chains by
	\begin{align*}
		c_i^{\text{start}} \colon (t_1, \dots, t_{k-1}) &\mapsto
			c(t_1, \dots, t_{i-1}, 0, t_i, \dots, t_k) \\
		c_i^{\text{stop}} \colon (t_1, \dots, t_{k-1}) & \mapsto
			c(t_1, \dots, t_{i-1}, 1, t_i, \dots, t_k).
	\end{align*}
	Then
	\[ \partial c \defeq
	\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^{i+1} \left( c_i^{\text{stop}} - c_i^{\text{start}}  \right). \]
	Finally, the boundary of a chain is the sum of the boundaries of each cell (with the appropriate weights).
	That is, $\partial(\sum a_ic_i) = \sum a_i \partial c_i$.
\end{definition}
\begin{ques}
	Satisfy yourself that one can extend this definition to
	a $k$-cell $c$ defined on $c \colon [a_1, b_1] \times \dots \times [a_k, b_k] \to V$
	(rather than from $[0,1]^k \to V$).
\end{ques}

\begin{example}
	[Examples of boundaries]
	Consider the $2$-cell $c \colon [0,1]^2 \to \RR^2$ shown below.
	\begin{center}
		\begin{asy}
			size(7cm);
			pen e1 = heavyred;
			pen e2 = orange;
			pen e3 = olive;
			pen e4 = heavymagenta;
			draw((0,0)--(2,0), e1, EndArrow);
			draw((2,0)--(2,2), e2, EndArrow);
			draw((2,2)--(0,2), e3, EndArrow);
			draw((0,2)--(0,0), e4, EndArrow);
			label(scale(0.8)*"$[0,1]^2$", (1,1));
			draw( (3,1)--(6,1), EndArrow);
			label("$c$", (4.5,1), dir(90));
			pair p1 = (7,-1);
			pair p2 = (12,-2);
			pair p3 = (11,3);
			pair p4 = (8,2);
			fill(p1--p2--p3--p4--cycle, palecyan);
			draw(p1--p2, e1, EndArrow, Margins);
			draw(p2--p3, e2, EndArrow, Margins);
			draw(p3--p4, e3, EndArrow, Margins);
			draw(p4--p1, e4, EndArrow, Margins);
			dot("$p_1$", p1, dir(225), blue+4);
			dot("$p_2$", p2, dir(315), blue+4);
			dot("$p_3$", p3, dir( 45), blue+4);
			dot("$p_4$", p4, dir(135), blue+4);
			label("$c$", (p1+p2+p3+p4)/4);
		\end{asy}
	\end{center}
	Here $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, $p_4$ are the images of $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, $(1,0)$, respectively.
	Formally, $\partial c$ is given by
	\[ \partial c = \left( (t \mapsto c(1,t)) - (t \mapsto c(0,t)) \right)
		- \left( (t \mapsto c(t,1)) - (t \mapsto c(t,0)) \right). \]
	I apologize for the eyesore notation caused by inline functions.
	Let's make amends and just write
	\[ \partial c = [p_2,p_3] - [p_1,p_4] - [p_4,p_3] + [p_1,p_2] \]
	where each ``interval'' represents the $1$-cell shown by the reddish arrows on the right,
	after accounting for the minus signs.
	We can take the boundary of this as well, and obtain an empty chain as
	\[ \partial(\partial c) = \sum_{i=1}^4 \{p_{i+1}\}-\{p_i\} = 0. \]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	[Boundary of a unit disk]
	Consider the unit disk given by
	\[ c \colon [0,1] \times [0,2\pi] \to \RR^2 \quad\text{by}\quad
	(r,\theta) \mapsto s\cos(2\pi t)\ee_1 + s\sin(2\pi t)\ee_2. \]
	The four parts of the boundary are shown in the picture below:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{asy}
			size(7cm);
			pen e1 = heavyred;
			pen e2 = orange;
			pen e3 = olive;
			pen e4 = heavymagenta;
			draw((0,0)--(2,0), e1, EndArrow);
			draw((2,0)--(2,2), e2, EndArrow);
			draw((2,2)--(0,2), e3, EndArrow);
			draw((0,2)--(0,0), e4, EndArrow);
			label("$r$", (2,0), dir(-45));
			label("$\theta$", (0,2), dir(135));

			label(scale(0.8)*"$[0,1]^2$", (1,1));
			draw( (3,1)--(6,1), EndArrow);
			label("$c$", (4.5,1), dir(90));

			pair O = (9,1);
			pair P = O + 2*dir(0);
			fill(CP(O,P), palecyan);
			real eps = 0.3;
			draw(shift(0,eps) * (O--P), e1, EndArrow, Margins);
			draw(shift(0,-eps) * (P--O), e3, EndArrow, Margins);
			draw(CP(O,P), e2, EndArrow, Margins);
			dot(O, e4+4);
		\end{asy}
	\end{center}
	Note that two of the arrows more or less cancel each other out when they are integrated.
	Moreover, we interestingly have a \emph{degenerate} $1$-cell at the center of the circle;
	it is a constant function $[0,1] \to \RR^2$ which always gives the origin.
\end{example}

Obligatory theorem, analogous to $d^2=0$ and left as a problem.
\begin{theorem}[The boundary of the boundary is empty]
	$\partial^2 = 0$, in the sense that for any $k$-chain $c$ we have $\partial^2(c) = 0$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Stokes' theorem}
\prototype{$\int_{[a,b]} dg = g(b) - g(a)$.}

We now have all the ingredients to state Stokes' theorem for cells.
\begin{theorem}
	[Stokes' theorem for cells]
	Take $U \subseteq V$ as usual, let $c \colon [0,1]^k \to U$ be a $k$-cell
	and let $\alpha \colon U \to \Lambda^{k-1}(V^\vee)$ be a $(k-1)$-form.
	Then
	\[ \int_c d\alpha = \int_{\partial c} \alpha. \]
	In particular, if $d\alpha = 0$ then the left-hand side vanishes.
\end{theorem}
For example, if $c$ is the interval $[a,b]$ then $\partial c = \{b\} - \{a\}$,
and thus we obtain the fundamental theorem of calculus.
