\section{Notions of convergence}
\subsection{Almost sure convergence}
\begin{definition}
	Let $X$, $X_n$ be random variables on a probability space $\Omega$.
	We say $X_n$ \vocab{converges almost surely} to $X$ if
	\[ \mu \left( \omega \in \Omega :
		\lim_n X_n(\omega) = X(\omega) \right) = 1. \]
\end{definition}
This is a very strong notion of convergence:
it says in almost every \emph{world},
the values of $X_n$ converge to $X$.
In fact, it is almost better for me to give a \emph{non-example}.
\begin{example}
	[Non-example of almost sure convergence]
	Imagine an immortal skeleton archer is practicing shots,
	and on the $n$th shot, he scores a bulls-eye with probability
	$1 - \frac 1n$
	(which tends to $1$ because the archer improves over time).
	Let $X_n \in \{0, 1, \dots, 10\}$ be the score of the $n$th shot.

	Although the skeleton is gradually approaching perfection,
	there are \emph{almost no worlds} in which the archer
	misses only finitely many shots: that is
	\[ \mu \left( \omega \in \Omega :
		\lim_n X_n(\omega) = 10 \right) = 0. \]
\end{example}

\subsection{Convergence in probability}
Therefore, for many purposes we need a weaker notion of convergence.
\begin{definition}
	Let $X$, $X_n$ be random variables on a probability space $\Omega$.
	We say $X_n$ \vocab{converges in probability} to $X$ if
	if for every $\eps > 0$ and $\delta > 0$, we have
	\[ \mu \left( \omega \in \Omega :
			\left\lvert X_n(\omega) - X(\omega) \right\rvert < \eps
		\right) \ge 1 - \delta  \]
	for $n$ large enough (in terms of $\eps$ and $\delta$).
\end{definition}
In this sense, our skeleton archer does succeed:
for any $\delta > 0$, if $n > \delta\inv$
then the skeleton archer does hit a bulls-eye
in a $1-\delta$ fraction of the worlds.
In general, you can think of this as saying that for any $\delta > 0$,
the chance of an $\eps$-anomaly event at the $n$th stage
eventually drops below $\delta$.

\begin{remark}
	To mask $\delta$ from the definition,
	this is sometimes written instead as:
	for all $\eps$
	\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu \left( \omega \in \Omega :
		\left\lvert X_n(\omega) - X(\omega) \right\rvert < \eps
		\right) = 1. \]
	I suppose it doesn't make much difference,
	though I personally don't like the asymmetry.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Convergence in law}

\section{Weak law of large numbers}

As the name implies, this is a direct corollary of the strong law of large numbers.
Nevertheless, the proof of this law is simpler, and some applications only require the weak law.

\subsection{Application: Weierstrass approximation}

\section{Strong law of large numbers}

\subsection{Motivation: Biased random walk}

Consider a random walk defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\ii Let $X_0 = 1$.
	\ii For each $i \geq 1$, define $X_i$ to be $X_{i-1}-1$ with probability $p=0.6$
	or $X_{i-1}+1$ with probability $1-p=0.4$.
\end{itemize}

Then we can ask: What's the expected number of steps until some $X_i$ equals $0$?

A naive attempt might be the following.
\begin{quote}
	Let $f(i)$ be the expected number of steps starting to reach $0$ starting from $X_0=i$.

	Then:
	\begin{itemize}
		\ii $f(0)=0$,
		\ii $f(1)=1+0.6 f(0)+0.4 f(2)$,
		\ii $f(2)=1+0.6 f(1)+0.4 f(3)$,
		\ii $\vdots$
	\end{itemize}
\end{quote}
This isn't getting anywhere because there are infinitely many terms.
A better attempt is the following:
\begin{quote}
	Let the answer be $x$.
	If we start from $X_0=2$, let $i$ be the first time such that $X_i=1$
	and $j$ be the first time after $i$ such that $X_j=0$. Then
	\[ \EE[i]=\EE[j-i]=x. \]
	Therefore,
	\[ x = 1 + 0.6 \cdot 0 + 0.4 \cdot (2x) \]
	Solving the equation, we get $x=5$.
\end{quote}
It gives the correct result --- however, the same method gives $x=-5$ when
the probability of going down is $p=0.4$, which is clearly nonsense.

What went wrong? The problem is when $p=0.4$, there is a nonzero probability\footnote{%
	Preview: Using martingale theory next chapter, you will be able to prove the probability
	the sequence never reaches $0$ is exactly $1-\frac{0.4}{0.6}$.
} that the
sequence never reaches $0$, so the expected value is undefined
and we're subtracting $\infty$ from $\infty$ in the proof.

In this case, the strong law of large numbers can help us patch this hole, by showing that in almost
every world, the sequence $X_i$ eventually reaches $0$.

\subsection{Statement}

\begin{theorem}[Strong law of large numbers]
Let $X_1$, $X_2$, \dots\ be i.i.d. random variables with mean $0$.
Define the partial mean
\[ M_n = \frac{X_1+\dots+X_n}{n}. \]
Then, in almost every world, $M_n \to 0$.
\end{theorem}
In other words, $M_n$ converges almost surely to $0$.

The requirement that the mean is $0$ is only to simplify the proof,
as long as the mean exists, we can subtract the mean from the random variables and apply the
theorem.

\begin{example}[The hypothesis {$\EE[X_i]=0$} is important]
	Consider an example where $M_n \to 0$ does not hold ---
	this is a minor variation of the St. Petersburg paradox.

	Let the distribution of each $X_i$ be as follows:
	\begin{align*}
		X_i &= \begin{cases}
			1&\text{with probability }\frac{1}{4} \\
			-1&\text{with probability }\frac{1}{4} \\
			2&\text{with probability }\frac{1}{8} \\
			-2&\text{with probability }\frac{1}{8} \\
			4&\text{with probability }\frac{1}{16} \\
			-4&\text{with probability }\frac{1}{16} \\
			&\vdots
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	Formally, $X_i$ takes each of the value in $\{2^k,-2^k\}$ with probability $2^{-k-2}$.

	In this case, the mean $\EE[X_i] = \int_\Omega X_i(\omega)$ is actually undefined.
	Furthermore, as symmetric as the distribution may look, in almost no world will $M_n$ converge
	to $0$.

	Intuitively, you can see why:
	\begin{itemize}
		\ii Within the first $16$ values, on average there's one $X_i$ with $|X_i|=4$,
		this will skew $M_{16}$ by $\frac{1}{4}$.
		\ii Within the first $32$ values, on average there's one $X_i$ with $|X_i|=8$,
		this will skew $M_{32}$ by $\frac{1}{4}$.
		\ii Et cetera.
	\end{itemize}
	In other words, just like our skeleton archer, there are almost no worlds in which the $M_n$
	got skewed by more than $\frac{1}{4}$ only finitely many times.
\end{example}

\subsection{Proof for finite-variance case}

In practice, most distribution we ever come across has finite variance,
it may be better to give a counterexample.

\begin{example}[A distribution with finite mean but infinite variance]
	Taking $Y_i = \opname{sgn}(X_i) \sqrt{|X_i|}$ where $X_i$ is the St. Petersburg paradox example
	above suffices. If you do the math, you will see $\EE[Y_i] = 0$, but $\EE[Y_i^2] = \infty$.
\end{example}

We will give a proof when $\EE[X_i^2]$ is finite first.

First, we define a seemingly unrelated series as follows:
\[ T_n = X_1+\frac{X_2}{2}+\frac{X_3}{3}+\dots+\frac{X_n}{n}. \]

This step is a bit difficult to motivate.
On the positive side, it is easy to show the following:
\begin{claim}
	In almost every world, the sequence $T_n$ converges.
\end{claim}
That is the same as saying the series
\[ X_1+\frac{X_2}{2}+\frac{X_3}{3}+\cdots \]
converges.

The key idea is to show that the total variance of the summands are finite.
Indeed:
\begin{align*}
	\Var\left[X_1\right] + \Var\left[\frac{X_2}{2}\right] + \Var\left[\frac{X_3}{3}\right] + \cdots
	&= \Var[X_1] + \frac{1}{4} \Var[X_2] + \frac{1}{9} \Var[X_3] + \cdots \\
	&= \Var[X_1] \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} + \cdots \right)
\end{align*}
which is finite.

Why should finite total variance imply almost surely convergence?
Intuitively, we recall:
\begin{theorem}[Chebyshev's inequality]
	Let $X$ be a random variable with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma^2$.
	Then
	\[ \Pr[|X| \geq k \sigma] \leq \frac{1}{k^2}. \]
\end{theorem}
Or equivalently we can write it in the following form, which avoid the $\sqrt{-}$ implicit in
the definition of $\sigma$:
\[ \Pr[|X| \geq a] \leq \frac{1}{a^2} \Var[X]. \]

So if we look at, say, $T_{1000}$ and $T_{2000}$:
\[ \Var[T_{2000}-T_{1000}] = \sum_{i=1001}^{2000} \frac{\Var[X_i]}{i^2} \]
Because $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{\Var[X_i]}{i^2}$ is finite, we expect
$\sum_{i=1001}^{2000} \frac{\Var[X_i]}{i^2}$ to be very small, which means $T_{2000}$ should deviate
very little from $T_{1000}$.

To show convergence, we need something stronger, however.
\begin{theorem}[Kolmogorov's inequality]
	Let $X_1$, \dots, $X_n$ be independent random variables with mean $0$.
	Define $S_i = X_1+\dots+X_i$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n$.
	Then
	\[ \Pr[|S_i| \geq a \text{ for any }1 \leq i \leq n]
		\leq \frac{1}{a^2} \Var[S_n]. \]
\end{theorem}
You can see why this theorem is stronger --- with Chebyshev's inequality, we can only show
\[ \Pr[|S_n| \geq a] \leq \frac{1}{a^2} \Var[S_n]. \]
So, with the same right hand side, we can also bound the probability of
$|S_1|\geq a \vee |S_2| \geq a \vee \cdots$ for free!
\begin{proof}
	Define $A_i$ be the event that $i$ is the smallest value such that $|S_i|\geq a$. Then the left
	hand side above equals
	\[ \Pr[|S_i| \geq a \text{ for any }1 \leq i \leq n] = \Pr[A_1]+\Pr[A_2]+\dots+\Pr[A_n]. \]

	Intuitively, if the events $|S_i|\geq a$ were independent,
	the best we can do is to use Chebyshev's inequality to bound individual probability values:
	\[ \Pr[|S_i|\geq a] \leq \frac{1}{a^2} \Var[S_i] \]
	However, they're very much not independent --- in fact, they are positively correlated!
	For example, we have:
	\[ \EE[S_n \mid S_1 = a] = a \]
	because $\EE[X_2+\dots+X_n] = 0$.
	So if each $X_i$ is symmetrically distributed, $\Pr[S_n \geq a \mid S_1 = a] \geq \frac{1}{2}$,
	which is much larger than $\frac{1}{a^2} \Var[S_n]$ for large $a$.

	Here is the formal proof.
	For each $1 \leq i \leq n$, we have
	\[ \EE[S_i^2 \mid A_i] \geq a^2 \]
	which is equivalent to
	\[ \Pr[A_i] \leq \frac{1}{a^2} \EE[S_i^2 \cdot \mathbf{1}_{A_i}] \]
	and
	\begin{align*}
		\EE[S_n^2 \cdot \mathbf{1}_{A_i}]
		&= \EE[(S_i + (S_n-S_i))^2 \cdot \mathbf{1}_{A_i}] \\
		&= \EE[S_i^2 \cdot \mathbf{1}_{A_i}]
		+ \EE[S_i  \cdot \mathbf{1}_{A_i} (S_n-S_i)]
		+ \EE[(S_n-S_i)^2 \cdot \mathbf{1}_{A_i}] \\
	\end{align*}
	The middle term $\EE[S_i  \cdot \mathbf{1}_{A_i} (S_n-S_i)]$ is $0$
	because $S_i  \cdot \mathbf{1}_{A_i}$ and $S_n-S_i = X_{i+1}+\dots+X_n$ are independent
	and $\EE[X_{i+1}+\dots+X_n]=0$,
	and the last term is $\geq 0$.

	Combining the inequalities, we get
	\[ a^2 \Pr[A_i] \leq \EE[S_n^2 \cdot \mathbf{1}_{A_i}]. \]
	Summing over all $i$ gives the final result.
\end{proof}

Generalizing:
\begin{corollary}
	Let $X_1$, \dots\ be independent random variables with mean $0$. Define $S_i$ as above. Then
	\[ \Pr[|S_i| \geq a \text{ for any }1 \leq i] \leq \frac{1}{a^2} \sum_{1 \leq i} \Var[X_i]. \]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	The event
	\[ |S_i| \geq a \text{ for any }1 \leq i \leq n \]
	is a subset of the event
	\[ |S_i| \geq a \text{ for any }1 \leq i \leq n+1 \]
	therefore we have
	\[ \Pr[|S_i| \geq a \text{ for any }1 \leq i]
	= \lim_{n \to \infty} \Pr[|S_i| \geq a \text{ for any }1 \leq i \leq n]. \]
	Applying Kolmogorov's inequality on each $\Pr[|S_i| \geq a \text{ for any }1 \leq i \leq n]$,
	we get the result.
\end{proof}

Now, the idea is to apply this on the \emph{tails} of the sequence
\[ X_1, \frac{X_2}{2}, \frac{X_3}{3}, \dots \]
By the corollary, we know that for every $\eps>0$, in almost every world,
there exists $n_\eps$ such that for arbitrary $i \geq n_\eps$,
$|T_i-T_{n_\eps}|<\frac{\eps}{2}$. By triangle inequality, for arbitrary $i, j \geq n_\eps$,
then $|T_i-T_j|<\eps$.

By Cauchy's criterion for convergence,
this implies the sequence $T_n$ is convergent in almost every world.

Finally, here is the relation with the original goal:
\begin{claim}[Relation with the original series]
	In every world where $T_n$ converges, then $M_n$ converges to $0$.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
	Just a bit of algebraic manipulation.
	We try to write $M_n$ in terms of $T_n$.

	We have
	\[ X_n = n \cdot (T_n-T_{n-1}) \]
	so
	\begin{align*}
		M_n &= \frac{(T_1-T_0) +2(T_2-T_1) + \dots + n(T_n-T_{n-1})}{n} \\
			&= \frac{n T_n - (T_0+T_1+\cdots+T_{n-1})}{n} \\
			&= T_n - \frac{T_0+T_1+\cdots+T_{n-1}}{n}.
	\end{align*}
	Now this is easy: given $T_n$ converges,
	$\frac{T_0+T_1+\cdots+T_{n-1}}{n}$ must also converge to the same value (Ces\`aro mean),
	so $M_n \to 0$ as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
	The converse is not true: if $M_n \to 0$, $T_n$ does not necessarily converge.
	Find a counterexample. (Write $T_n$ in terms of $M_n$, and see what happens.)
\end{exercise}

\subsection{The general proof}

The basic idea is to truncate the value of each $X_i$ so that each of them has finite variance.

\begin{problem}
	[Quantifier hell]
	\gim
	In the definition of convergence in probability
	suppose we allowed $\delta = 0$
	(rather than $\delta > 0$).
	Show that the modified definition is
	equivalent to almost sure convergence.
	\begin{hint}
		This is actually trickier than it appears,
		you cannot just push quantifiers (contrary to the name),
		but have to focus on $\eps = 1/m$ for $m = 1, 2, \dots$.

		The problem is saying for each $\eps > 0$,
		if $n > N_\eps$, we have
		$\mu(\omega : |X(\omega)-X_n(\omega)| \le \eps) = 1$.
		For each $m$ there are some measure zero ``bad worlds'';
		take the union.
	\end{hint}
	\begin{sol}
		For each positive integer $m$,
		consider what happens when $\eps = 1/m$.
		Then, by hypothesis, there is a threshold $N_m$
		such that the \emph{anomaly set}
		\[ A_m \defeq \left\{ \omega :
			|X(\omega)-X_n(\omega)| \ge \frac 1m
			\text{ for some } n > N_m \right\} \]
		has measure $\mu(A_m) = 0$.
		Hence, the countable union $A = \bigcup_{m \ge 1} A_m$ has measure zero too.

		So the complement of $A$ has measure $1$.
		For any world $\omega \notin A$,
		we then have
		\[ \lim_n \left\lvert X(\omega) - X_n(\omega) \right\rvert = 1 \]
		because when $n > N_m$ that absolute value
		is always at most $1/m$ (as $\omega \notin A_m$).
